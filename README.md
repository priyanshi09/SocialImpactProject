The Second Avenue Subway is the Metropolitan Transportation Authorityâ€™s (MTA) latest addition to the public transportation network, and is being built in three phases. The first phase comprises three new stations (96thStreet,86thStreetand72ndStreetstations)intheUpperEast       Side neighborhood, and began operationonJanuary1,2017. 

The project aims to understand the short-term and long-term impacts of the new Q line extension.  
Short-term impact questions: 
- Are UES residents changing modes of transport? 
- Is the Second Avenue subway relieving congestion on the Lexington Avenue line?  
- Has there been an overall increase in subway ridership?
Long-term impact question: 
- How has the opening of the subway extension affected real estate prices? 
- How would this help in increasing public safety and reduction in crimes ? 
- How would it help in the economic development of the the three neighbourhoods in Upper East Side and further the whole area along the complete proposed line?
